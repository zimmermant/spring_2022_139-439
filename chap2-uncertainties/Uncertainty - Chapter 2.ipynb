    "## 2.4 Measurement and uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    " The broad aim of performing measurements in science is to increase our knowledge about some physical quantity which is referred to as the **measurand**. For example, a measurand may be the length of a box, the vapour pressure of a given sample of water at 20 °C, or the speed of light in some medium. The first thing that you, as the measurer, have to do is to specify the measurand. You need to ask yourself, “What do I want to measure? The next step is to think about what you already know about the measurand and to choose an appropriate **measurement procedure** and **apparatus** for making the measurement. Clearly the purpose of the measurement also plays a role.\n",
    " \n",
    "We should not think about the measurand as possessing some “true value” that has to be uncovered but rather that the value of the measurand is based on the amount of information we have at hand. If you really wanted to know the ultimate or true value of the measurand you will need an infinite amount of information !\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the information we have about a measurand can be never 100% complete. For example, we saw earlier that whether we are dealing with a digital or an analogue instrument, the information about the measurand from the reading is in fact an <u>interval</u> which cannot be reduced to a point. So, even there are no other factors influencing the measurement the scale would limit what we know and **the final result of a measurement will always be an interval**. However, as we saw at the end of Chapter 1 there are usually several factors that will influence the measurement. Each of these factors makes the interval associated with the final result bigger. We call this interval the uncertainty. Thus, the larger the uncertainty the less we know and the more we know the smaller the uncertainty. When designing an experiment the aim is try and make the uncertainty as small as possible, but with knowledge that the uncertainty interval cannot be reduced to zero. We will learn how to calculate uncertainties in the next chapter1. (Uncertainty is a technical term so <u>do not confuse</u> it with everyday usuage, such “I am uncertain whether I should go to the party tonight!)”\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C2-Fig14.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "1 Many books and notes use the term “error” or “error analysis” when describing experiments. For example, it is common to see discussion about “random” and “systematic errors”. We will not use any of these terms and only use the term uncertainty which is well defined. If you do have to learn the older type of data analysis in another course take great care to distinguish between the terms “error” and “uncertainty .” They are not synonyms, but represent completely different concepts. “Error” is an idealized concept that denotes the difference between the measured value and “a true value” of that quantity. Since the “true value” is never known, neither is the error. Uncertainty on the other hand is a well defined term that can be calculated meaningfully as you will see later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of measurement is to try and minimise the uncertainty when we perform an experiment. This can be achieved by good experimental design as well as by collecting as much data as possible. At the end of Chapter 1 you were asked to write down all the factors that could influence the result of your measurement. Each of these factors can be thought of as working against our having perfect knowledge about a measurand and adds to the overall uncertainty. A crucial aspect of experimentation is to identify all such sources of\n",
    "uncertainty and to numerically estimate their effect on your measurement result. Common sources of uncertainty include:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) the effects of environmental conditions on the measurement; (b) your judgement in reading analogue instruments;\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) the sensitivity of your instruments (e.g. the digital scale);\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) the rating or stated calibration of the instrument;\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) approximations and assumptions that you make while doing the experiment; and (f) variations in repeated readings made under apparently identical conditions.\n",
    "A measurement uncertainty is not meant to be an indication of “mistakes” that you might make in an experiment. If you are aware that you have made a mistake, then you should repeat your experiment. “Human error” is not a valid source of uncertainty. If you know that you did something “wrong”, then why don’t you do it correctly?"
