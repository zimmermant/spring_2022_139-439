The ISO recommendations have been adopted by the majority of world standards bodies such as IUPAP (International Union of Pure and Applied Physics), UIPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), etc., and affects the way in which the results of measurements and uncertainties are reported in all scientific work.\n",

However, the question that you need to ask yourself is the same, “From my data (and other information that I might have), what do I know about the measurand?” The procedure that allows us to go from the data we have collected, to making a statement (an inference) about the measurand itself is based on **probability theory**. The mathematical functions that we use in this process are, in fact, **probability density functions (pdf’s)**, which are used to model all the information that we have about the particular measurand.\n",

The “average width” of the pdf is a measure of the quality of our knowledge about the measurand and is referred to as the **standard uncertainty**, (symbol u). In other words, the more spread out the pdf, the greater the standard uncertainty. On the other hand, the narrower the pdf is, the smaller the standard uncertainty.\n",
