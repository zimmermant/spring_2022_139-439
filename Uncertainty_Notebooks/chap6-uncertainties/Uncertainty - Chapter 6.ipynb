A starter’s pistol (used to start races at athletic meetings) was fired several times, and each time a large group of students used stopwatches to record the time between hearing the original bang and the echo after the sound reflected back from a wall which was about 80 metres away. In this way a large number of readings for the time $t$ were collected. The distance $d$ was measured once by a smaller group of students using a measuring tape.\n",
