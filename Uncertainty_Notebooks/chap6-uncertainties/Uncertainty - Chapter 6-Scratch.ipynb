    "# 6 Evaluations of uncertainty: a practical example\n",

    "In this chapter you will do an experiment to measure the speed of sound in air and use the opportunity to further develop your understanding about measurement and uncertainty.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6.1 The speed of sound experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you have just returned from doing an experiment on a sports field. A starter’s pistol (used to start races at athletic meetings) was fired several times, and each time a large group of students used stopwatches to record the time between hearing the original bang and the echo after the sound reflected back from a wall which was about 80 metres away. In this way a large number of readings for the time $t$ were collected. The distance $d$ was measured once by a smaller group of students using a measuring tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C6-Fig1.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the experiment is to measure the speed of the sound in air vs which may be calculated by $v_s = 2d t$ . In order to know something about $v_s$ , we first need to analyse our data for $t$ and $d$ separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Analyzing the time data\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of data for $t$ which were taken by a previous class is given below so that we can all work with the same values. This data can be loaded from the file ```speed_of_sound_time_data.csv``` (The .csv extension means the file contains comma separated values, a file format that is easy for Python to read)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"C6-Fig2.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear just by looking at Table 6.1 that the time readings are dispersed. Why do you think this is so? What are the possible causes of the scatter?  Enter your answer in the cell below by replacing the text between the quote symbols with your answer."

Our data is stored in a variable named ```time_data``` and we only want to look at the ```Times``` so our command will start with ```time_data.Times```.  We want to create a ```plot``` and the type of plot we want to create is a histogram or a ```hist```.  A histogram divides the total data up into several ranges (each called a bin) and counts how many values falls within each range or bin.  The plot shows how many of your measurements falls into each range or bin.  Right now we are dividing our data into two bins, one from 0.2 seconds to 0.5 seconds, and another bin from 0.5 seconds to 0.9 seconds.  There are roughly 26 measurements in the first range and 22 measurements in the second range. "
