    "## 1.5 Measurement in science\n",
    "\n",
    "The enterprise of scientific enquiry is about understanding the phenomena of nature, and therefore the main purpose of a measurement in science is to provide knowledge about a particular quantity. What constitutes valid and reliable scientific knowledge is not easy to define and this issue has been explored by scientists, philosophers and sociologists for as long as modern science has existed. For our purposes we can think of science as progressing along two separate but tightly interwoven fronts, namely theory and experiment. The purpose of a theory is to describe and explain the results of experiments and to make predictions about the outcomes of future experiments.\n",
    "On the other hand, experiments involve systematic observations of events under conditions that are controlled and understood as well as possible. Experiments involve making measurements of various quantities with the aim of providing the most trustworthy information possible. The quality of the data from an experiment depends critically on the design of the experiment, how carefully the procedures are carried out and how well all influences on the measurements are understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are well-defined concepts and procedures concerned with processing and reporting scientific measurements. For example, the concept of “work” in physics has a very particular meaning which is almost nothing to do with your everyday use of the word. Learning how to draw a force diagram is an important skill when learning mechanics. You will learn some very important ideas and procedures which are central to measurement in science. Some of the words that you will come across also have an “everyday” meaning, therefore you will need to be careful when thinking about the context within which these new ideas and procedures have particular significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a key purpose of the scientific enterprise is concerned with gaining knowledge about a quantity, an important aspect of all experimental work involves deciding what measurements to take and identifying all the factors that could influence the measurement result. These factors which might be related to any aspect of the experiment (the environment, the skill of the experimenter, the instrument used, etc.) all work against obtaining the “perfect” result. During this course you will see how to incorporate these influences more formally into your analysis of the data from an experiment. You will come to understand that an important aspect of a scientific measurement is to reduce the effect of these factors on a measurement result, thereby improving your knowledge about the quantity you are measuring.\n",

    "Because of the central role that measurements play in science, engineering and technology, it is important that scientific measurements are analyzed and recorded in ways that are meaningful to all scientists. International standards bodies have been set up for such purposes and publish guidelines dealing with various aspects of terminology, accepted ways of reporting particular types of measurements, etc. Of interest to us are the guidelines of the International Organisation for Standardisation published in 1993 and 1995 with regard to the general way in which data are to be treated and measurement results reported. A large part of this course will therefore deal with aspects of **metrology**, the science of measurement."
