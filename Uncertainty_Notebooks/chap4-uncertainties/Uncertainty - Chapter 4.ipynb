        "The purpose of making a measurement in science is to obtain information about a **measurand**. The first thing that the measurer, i.e. you, has to do is to clearly specify the measurand. You need to ask yourself, “What do I want to measure?” The answer to this question gives you the “measurand”. You always need to be careful when you specify the measurand. For example, if you want to measure the length of a bar of iron to 0.000001 of a metre, then it would be appropriate to also specify the temperature and pressure (and any other parameters) that might affect the result.\n",

There are many effects which contribute towards the total uncertainty in a measurement, including the rating of the instrument, reading the scale of the instrument, etc. All these effects need to be considered as part of the measurement process, and estimated numerically. The summary of all the sources of uncertainty in a measurement is called an “**uncertainty budget**”, just like the summary of all the expenses in a business is also called a budget. A scientific measurement is meaningless without a quantitative analysis of sources of uncertainty.\n",
